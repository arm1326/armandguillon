     <h2>In this page, I talk about my professionnal project</h2>
            <p>In the future, I would like to become an Information Systems Manager. 
            The goal in attaining this position would be to take on responsibilities and, ideally, to supervise a team of technicians.
            Through this role, I would be able to manage an IT infrastructure. Ultimately, my goal would be to reach a management position where 
            I could contribute to the leadership and operation of a company, building on the skills I acquire through my experience.</p>

            <p>Regarding my future studies, I’m not yet sure if I want to continue or not at this time. 
            However, I am considering attending an engineering school to strengthen my skills in networking and cybersecurity, 
            an area I greatly enjoy.</p>

            <p>As for my ideal working conditions, I would like a position that allows me to visit other countries, which would help me develop international skills. A company car would also be ideal to facilitate my travel. Finally, I would like to work in a location close to the countryside while still remaining near a city, so that I could live in a calm environment and maintain a good work-life balance.</p>
